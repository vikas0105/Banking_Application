Banking App
This is a simple banking application with microservices architecture. The frontend is built with React and served using Nginx. The backend includes multiple microservices such as Account Service, Transaction Service, and Analytics Service, all managed using Docker Compose.

Features
Frontend: React-based UI served via Nginx.
Microservices:
Account Service
Transaction Service
Analytics Service
API Gateway
Containerized Deployment: Docker and Docker Compose for managing services.
Prerequisites
An AWS EC2 instance with the following installed:
Docker: Install Docker
Docker Compose: Install Docker Compose
Open ports in the EC2 security group (e.g., 8080 for frontend, 5000-5003 for backend).

Setup and Deployment
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd banking-app
2. Build and Start the Services
Run the following command to build and start all services using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
3. Verify Services
Check running containers:
bash
Copy code
docker ps
Verify logs for all services:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose logs -f
4. Access the Application
Frontend: Open your browser and go to:

arduino
Copy code
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8080
Replace <EC2_PUBLIC_IP> with your EC2 instance's public IP.

Backend Microservices: Each service runs on its dedicated port (e.g., 5000 for API Gateway). Access them via:

php
Copy code
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:<SERVICE_PORT>
Frontend
Built with: React
Access URL: http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8080
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Port Not Accessible:
Ensure the security group of your EC2 instance allows inbound traffic on required ports.
Docker Not Running:
Restart Docker:
bash
Copy code
sudo service docker restart
Rebuild Containers
If you make changes to the code and need to rebuild containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Future Enhancements
Add authentication and user roles.
Integrate a database for persistent storage.
Implement additional microservices (e.g., Notification Service).
